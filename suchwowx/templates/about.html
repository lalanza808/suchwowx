              Welcome. </br>
            </br>
              This service is a continuation of <a href="https://suchwow.xyz">SuchWow</a> for the <a href="https://wownero.org">Wownero</a> cryptocurrency project.
              It has been remixed onto the <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche network</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.io">Interplanetary Filesystem</a> and launched with a smart contract with some useful features.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              Up until now there has been a small group of people who were responsible for reviewing and approving the 4600+ memes submitted to the prior platform.
              Wownero has become a meme powerhouse via SuchWow, but it's a highly centralized, aging, and fragile service.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              This iteration of SuchWow will strive to provide decentralized and leaderless operations.
              You can run it anywhere and see all the content, you don't need my server.
              You can control which content you see, store, and share (via IPFS pins).
              I'll deploy an immutable smart contract with what sounds aite,
              everyone can make their own clients (yall can use mine, it's flask),
              we make some documentation for you fucks to read (lol),
              then memers can run it and go to the races; the only limit is their own hard drives.
            </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            Server federation is a WIP. Stay tuned.
